This is my first blog post. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences here.

## Why I Started This Blog

I've always wanted a place to document my journey and share what I learn along the way. This blog will focus on technology, photography, and life in Vancouver.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- Software development and engineering
- Photography tips and techniques
- Life experiences and reflections

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something interesting here.
